## Supervised Learning with scikit-learn

### Classification



#### k-Nearest Neighbors: Fit

#Having explored the Congressional voting records dataset, it is time now to build your first classifier. In this exercise, you will fit a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier to the voting dataset, which has once again been pre-loaded for you into a DataFrame df.

#In the video, Hugo discussed the importance of ensuring your data adheres to the format required by the scikit-learn API. The features need to be in an array where each column is a feature and each row a different observation or data point - in this case, a Congressman's voting record. The target needs to be a single column with the same number of observations as the feature data. We have done this for you in this exercise. Notice we named the feature array X and response variable y: This is in accordance with the common scikit-learn practice.

#Your job is to create an instance of a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors (by specifying the n_neighbors parameter) and then fit it to the data. The data has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame called df.

#Instructions
#Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors.
#Create arrays X and y for the features and the target variable. Here this has been done for you. Note the use of .drop() to drop the target variable 'party' from the feature array X as well as the use of the .values attribute to ensure X and y are NumPy arrays. Without using .values, X and y are a DataFrame and Series respectively; the scikit-learn API will accept them in this form also as long as they are of the right shape.
#Instantiate a KNeighborsClassifier called knn with 6 neighbors by specifying the n_neighbors parameter.
#Fit the classifier to the data using the .fit() method.

# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
y = df['party'].values
X = df.drop('party', axis=1).values

# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X,y)


####k-Nearest Neighbors: Predict
#Having fit a k-NN classifier, you can now use it to predict the label of a new data point. However, there is no unlabeled data available since all of it was used to fit the model! You can still use the .predict() method on the X that was used to fit the model, but it is not a good indicator of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

#In the next video, Hugo will discuss a solution to this problem. For now, a random unlabeled data point has been generated and is available to you as X_new. You will use your classifier to predict the label for this new data point, as well as on the training data X that the model has already seen. Using .predict() on X_new will generate 1 prediction, while using it on X will generate 435 predictions: 1 for each sample.

#The DataFrame has been pre-loaded as df. This time, you will create the feature array X and target variable array y yourself.

#Instructions
#Create arrays for the features and the target variable from df. As a reminder, the target variable is 'party'.
#Instantiate a KNeighborsClassifier with 6 neighbors.
#Fit the classifier to the data.
#Predict the labels of the training data, X.
#Predict the label of the new data point X_new.

# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier 

# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
y = df['party'].values
X = df.drop('party', axis=1).values

# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors: knn
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X,y)

# Predict the labels for the training data X
y_pred = knn.predict(X)

# Predict and print the label for the new data point X_new
new_prediction = knn.predict(X_new)
print("Prediction: {}".format(new_prediction))
